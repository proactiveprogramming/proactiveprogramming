## About Proactive Programming and me
The name "ProactiveProgramming" comes from the fact that I take pride in creating software that works as it is expected
to work. It is an informal name that I have been using for the last 20 years for independent stuff I have worked on.
Most of it has been throw away code, which is why it was never posted on GitHub or other locations.  Or it has been
debugging of existing extensions for various projects.

### Fulltime employment 
Although I have tried to keep my skills up to date, I formally left industry in 2001 in order to be a fulltime parent 
and homeschool my children, Preschool through Grade 6.  Although, from a career perspective, my professional career took
a hit, from a personal perspective, I have no regrets.  

As the saying goes, "The proof of the pudding is under the crust".  My oldest son is currently in college studying engineering,
and he is doing very well.  My next son graduated class valivicatorian.  I take pride in knowing that I was the one who
built the foundation of their learning, including their work ethics and the foundations of their learning skills.

### Partime employment
For the last two years, I have been have had part-time paid freelance work writing articles on a wide variety of topics.
A selection of these articles is included in a repository called articles.

### Unpaid independent work
I have been working on three independent projects: BothSideDiscover, XtremeHebrew, and SolidVote.  

They are all still a work in progress, and I am unsure at the current time if I am going to open the products to the public or 
keep things proprietary.  Or if I will end up with a hybrid model of a simple version being open source and a more complete
and complex version being propreitary.
